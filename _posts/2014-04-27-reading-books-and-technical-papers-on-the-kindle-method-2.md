I'm trying to read a book similar to
<a title="Elements of Statistical Learning"
		href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics-ebook/dp/B00475AS2E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398537686&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=elements+of+statistical+learning"
		target="_blank">
	Elements of Statistical Learning
</a>
(aside: the book is freely available by one of the authors, Professor Rob Tibshirani,
<a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/" target="_blank">
	here
</a>
) on my Kindle, but the method I outlined in my previous post does not work
that well. Moreover, look at all the wasted space on the left and right
margins!

</a>

No matter what settings you apply (rotating and/or zooming), I have this margin
that's driving me nuts. Fortunately, after googling for PDF cropper, I came
across
<a title="briss" href="http://briss.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
	briss
</a>
. Briss is a PDF cropper that automatically crops the margins, and is able to
automatically detect exceptions like left and right pages, or even if images
are overflowing. Below is a screenshot from running briss on Elements of
Statistical Learning.

</a>
Briss in this case detected the title page should be handled separately.
Additionally, it detected that there is separate formatting for the margins of
the even and odd pages.

Now the final step is getting it to display on this kindle. Unfortunately,
in portrait mode there is still a margin because the Kindle tries to display
the entire page.

<a href="/assets/20140427_kportrait.jpg">
	<img class="size-medium wp-image-255 aligncenter" src="/assets/20140427_kportrait.jpg" alt="kportrait" width="217" height="300" />
</a>

As a result, you need to switch to landscape mode by going to 'Zoom &amp; Contrast'

<a href="/assets/20140427_klandscape.jpg">
	<img class="size-medium wp-image-256 aligncenter" src="/assets/20140427_klandscape.jpg" alt="klandscape" width="300" height="199" />
</a>

Viola! No more wasted space. Now you have no excuse not to read those technical books you've been putting off the last couple of months!
