Hey everyone,

Due to some people having issues getting the code to run, I have posted the complete example code on github. Just download the code and open it up in eclipse.

If you don't know how to use git, you can download a zip file of the sourcecode above, or run this command:
git clone git://github.com/josephmate/AndroidAppendableList.git

Cheers,
Joseph
