Today I learned that Javascript does not need a StringBuilder for accumulating a large number of concatinations.
As a Java programmer, that came as a shock to me.

# Effective Java
A StringBuilder is grilled into Java programmers. Effective Java says, "Item 51: Beware the performance of string concatenation."
Many books, articles, blog posts and stack overflow questions have extensively covered this in detail 
[2](http://www.thefinestartist.com/effective-java/51)
[3](http://jtechies.blogspot.com/2012/07/item-51-beware-performance-of-string.html)
[4](https://www.corejavaguru.com/effective-java/items/51)
[5](https://dzone.com/articles/string-concatenation-performacne-improvement-in-ja)
[6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4645020/when-to-use-stringbuilder-in-java)
[7](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10078912/best-practices-performance-mixing-stringbuilder-append-with-string-concat)
[8](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532461/stringbuilder-vs-string-concatenation-in-tostring-in-java).

Now you can see why it came as such a shock to me.
I assumed javascript would do the same thing as java to maintain the immutability of strings.
Java allocates a new array containing the result of each concatenation resulting in the O(N^2) runtime complexity.

# Experiments
When I first learned this from a co-worker, I couldn't believe it!
I put together some experiments to confirm.
I measured how long it would take to do different powers of 10 of concatenations in Java and javascript.

# Why Javascript Does not Need a StringBuilder

Following the experiments, I wanted to know why.
My research let me to [this email chain](https://www.mail-archive.com/es-discuss@mozilla.org/msg10071.html) where Dr. Axel Rauschmayer
proposes adding StringBuilder to the next version of ECMAScript,
> Is this worthy of ES.next support? Or does it belong into a library?
> 
> The two concatenation approaches I know of are:
> 1. via +=
> 2. push() into an array, join() it after the last push()
> 
> (1) canâ€™t possibly be efficient, but if (2) is OK on all(!) platforms, then a 
> library would be OK. However, given how frequently this is used, I would like 
> this to become part of the standard library.

[Tom Schuster responds](https://www.mail-archive.com/es-discuss@mozilla.org/msg10129.html) that it's no necessary.
> (1) is in  fact really good optimized in modern engines.  (In case you
are interested search for "Ropes: an alternative to strings")
> 
> I think today it's not a very good idea to propose methods on probably
existing performance problems.

I did more digging and learned the ropes are a datastructure the allow immutable String concatenations in O(lgN) time.

# Question to the Reader
Could Java implement a similar optimization to the JVM?
