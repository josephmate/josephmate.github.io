- [LongLineLasso](https://github.com/josephmate/LongLineLasso): Edits large files that have long lines. You can output text near matches or replace matches. Tried to get it to perform as well as grep, ripgrep, sed, and tr [but failed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephmate/LongLineLasso/main/performance_testing/flame_graph_match_v7.svg). My program is 10x slower than existing tools even though the file was one line.
